# PU-EVA: An Edge-Vector based Approximation Solution for Flexible-scale Point Cloud Upsampling
we propose a novel design of Edge-Vector based Approximation for Flexible-scale Point clouds Upsampling (PU-EVA). The proposed PU-EVA decouples the upsampling scales with network architecture, making the upsampling rate flexible in one-time end-to-end training.
